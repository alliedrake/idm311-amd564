                using Google Street View. With Wander you are able to historically jump to the past and also learn about
                different locations using Wikipedia integration.</p>

            <h2>WebGL / Quest 2  (1920x1080)</h2>
            <p>I redesigned this interface based off one of the main flows of the VR experience, which was 
                selecting where the user would like to travel to. I thought the orginal interface was a little smaller
                and not as aesthetically pleasing, so my focus was to make some of the features bigger and put the most
                necessary buttons near the focal point of the screen. The challenge was to allow the user to have easy access to
                these settings without it getting in the way of their view, and to clean up the interface without getting rid of
                important features. The two images for each screen size represents what the screen would look like when the menu is 
                closed and when it is opened.
