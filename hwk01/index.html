        <h2>WANDER - VR Interface Redesign</h2>
        <img src="images/wander.jpg" alt="wanderlogo" style="width: 80%;">
        <p>Wander is an exploration-based experience that allows you to teleport anywhere in the world
            using Google Street View. With Wander you are able to historically jump to the past and also learn about
            different locations using Wikipedia integration.</p>

        <h2>WebGL / Quest 2  (1920x1080)</h2>
        <p>I redesigned this interface based off one of the main flows of the VR experience, which was 
            selecting where the user would like to travel to. I thought the orginal interface was a little smaller
            and not as aesthetically pleasing, so my focus was to make some of the features bigger and put the most
            necessary buttons near the focal point of the screen. The challenge was to allow the user to have easy access to
            these settings without it getting in the way of their view, and to clean up the interface without getting rid of
            important features. The two images for each screen size represents what the screen would look like when the menu is 
            closed and when it is opened.
